# solid-octo-carnival-v2

This is a dummy repository I made so you can practice making pull requests. I created the repo as a sample to accompany [this blog post](https://linearb.io/blog/code-review-on-github) I wrote for the LinearB Blog.

Want to practice making pull requests? Just add one here and I'll accept it. Have fun ;)

**What you can practice here:**

* Creating a branch
* Making code changes
* Committing your changes
* Pushing your changes to GitHub
* Creating a pull request
* Responding to code review feedback
* Merging your pull request


This is amazing... :)
